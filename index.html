                <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                <p>Well, I'm so above you
                    And it's plain to see
                    But I came to love you anyway
                    So you pulled my heart out
                    And I don't mind bleedin'
                    Any old time, you keep me waitin'
                    Waitin', waitin'</p>

                    Am I born to bleed?

                <h2><a href="https://theblackkeys.com/pages/about-us">About the band</a></h2> 
                <p>Ten years after they pulled up their stakes and moved south to Nashville, leaving their gritty post-industrial hometown of Akron, Ohio, the birth place of rubber companies, waffle cones, oatmeal, and LeBron James; Patrick Carney and Dan Auerbach are back, at least metaphorically. On their ninth album “Let’s Rock”  the city of Akron is a silent partner, a third member on a recording that returns the duo to the straightforward, primitivism of their early canon, back to those days when Carney worshipped the Stooges, and Auerbach was enamored with Link Wray and the original James Gang guitarist Glenn Schwartz.</p>
